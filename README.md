# Daily Football Email Updates ⚽
<p>
As an avid football fan, I always do my best to keep up with all the matches that will happen throughout the week mainly through social media, and a couple of footballing apps in my phone. 
Now, it's all fun and games when you have the time to scroll through five or so different apps, but not so much when you start to miss out on match info since life keeps you busy with uni assignments and other committments.   
</p>

<p>
I do not like missing out on the action at all. So as a solution to keep myself updated daily on that matches that will be played on that day, 
I created a scheduled task workflow using WSO2's Choreo: a cloud-native integration and development platform. 
This workflow uses a custom python script that automatically fetches football match data from multiple leagues and emails a daily summary in a clean HTML format
</p>
<br>
<p>
🧐How the python script works:
</p>
<p>
1. The script fetches today's matches for required leagues (PL, PD, CL) using Football data-org's free tier API key.

2. Checks the UTC time so only future matches are included.

3. Formats matches into a clean HTML email.

3. Highlights matches with my favorite team (FC Barcelona).

4. Sends the email via SMTP automatically every morning using Choreo.

## 👾 Security Features

<p>As a Cybersecurity undergrad, I wanted this workflow to follow good security practices rather than just “function correctly.” To strengthen the reliability and safety of the solution, the below listed mechanisms were added:</p>

### 1. Secrets Handling
- SMTP credentials and all sensitive values are not hardcoded. Instead they're stored in the Choreo environment variables and are toggled as secrets, which encrypt and protect the data.

### 2. Rate Limiting
- A delay is added between API calls to avoid exceeding allowed request quotas.
- This Helps prevent accidental API abuse.

### 3. Input Validation
- Date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) is validated before making requests.
- Only valid league codes are processed to ensure API safety and predictable outputs.
